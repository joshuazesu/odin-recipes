        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Lasagna</strong> is a classic Italian pasta dish made with layers of wide, flat noodles, rich meat or vegetable fillings, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. The dish is baked until golden and bubbly, creating a comforting, hearty meal. Traditional versions often feature a ragù (slow-cooked meat sauce) with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs, while modern variations may include spinach, mushrooms, or seafood. Lasagna’s origins trace back to ancient Greece and Rome, but the version we know today evolved in Naples, Italy, becoming a staple in Italian-American cuisine.</p>
        <p>Known for its versatility, lasagna can be adapted to different dietary preferences, including vegetarian, vegan (using tofu or plant-based cheese), and gluten-free (with alternative noodles). Whether served as a family dinner or at gatherings, its layered structure allows flavors to meld beautifully, making it a crowd-pleaser. Pair it with garlic bread and a fresh salad for a complete meal, and enjoy the gooey, savory goodness that defines this beloved comfort food.</p>
