        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Kimchi jjigae</strong> (김치찌개) is a spicy, hearty Korean stew made primarily with fermented kimchi, tofu, pork (or tuna), and a flavorful broth. The dish is known for its bold, tangy taste from aged kimchi, combined with gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) and gochujang (fermented chili paste), creating a rich, umami-packed base. Often cooked in a stone pot, it’s served bubbling hot and is a staple in Korean households, especially as a comfort food during cold weather or to revive tired taste buds.</p>
        <p>Simple yet deeply satisfying, kimchi jjigae is versatile—some versions include additional ingredients like mushrooms, zucchini, or spam. It’s typically paired with steamed rice and banchan (side dishes), balancing the stew’s heat and acidity. The longer it simmers, the more the flavors meld, making it a perfect example of Korean home cooking at its most comforting and unpretentious.</p>
